              <p>
                <strong>Informal Resolution First:</strong> We believe disputes should be resolved informally. Before filing any claim against us, you agree to contact us at support@nutrioplus.co.uk to attempt to resolve the dispute informally. If we cannot resolve the dispute within 30 days, either party may pursue formal resolution.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Binding Arbitration:</strong> Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service, including formation, interpretation, breach, termination, or validity, shall be finally resolved by binding arbitration administered by the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) in accordance with its rules.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Arbitration Location and Language:</strong> The seat of arbitration shall be London, England. The arbitration shall be conducted in English.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Arbitrator Authority:</strong> The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of these Terms, including any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable.

              <p>
                <strong>Class Action Waiver:</strong> YOU AGREE THAT ANY PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION AGAINST US.

              <p>
                <strong>Exceptions:</strong> Notwithstanding the above, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court or seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of intellectual property rights.
